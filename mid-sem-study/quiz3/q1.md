# knowledge base theory

### knowledge base
```
a and b
b implies c
not d or e
```

### questions
```
How many atoms are there in the knowledge base?
How many distinct interpretation functions are there for this knowledge base?
How many models does this knowledge base have?
How many atoms are true in all the models of the knowledge base (i.e. logical consequences)?
```

## logic
- question 1: atoms are propositional variables, therefore, the number of atoms are is the size of the set of all the atoms. {a,b,c,de} = 5
- question 2: interpretation functions or interpretation or truth assignments assign either a True or False to each atom or propositional atom. Therefore, there is 5 atoms and each can either be true or false, 2^5 = 32
- question 3: models are a collection of assignments that make all propositional sentences true
- require constraint from single true cases
- avoid constraint from single false cases
- find the what variables need to be if they link
- figure out the rest of the remaining variables permutations
  - require A=T, B=T
  - avoid B=T, C=F
  - avoid D=T, E=F
    - Must have A=T and B=T
    - If must B=T, then must have C=T
    - If D=T then must have E=T or E can be anything else
  - A=T
  - B=T
  - C=T
  - D=T, E=T (Valid)
  - D=F, E=F (Valid)
  - D=T, E=F (Not valid)
  - D=F, E=F (Valid)
  - Therefore, 3 models

- question 4: A, B, C are always True. Therefore, 3
