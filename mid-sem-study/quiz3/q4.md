### knowledge bases containing only propositional definite clauses

## knowledge base
```
p :- q.
a :- b.
b.
```

## questions
```
How many distinct interpretation functions are there for this knowledge base?
How many models does this knowledge base have?
In how many models is a true?
In how many models is b true?
In how many models is p true?
In how many models is q true?
```

- question 1: A interpretation is a specific assignment of truth values to all the propositional variables. There are 4 distinct atoms or propositional variables and each has a possible truth value of True or False. Therefore, there is 2^4 = 16 possible interpretations or interpretation functions.
- question 2: NOTE: a:-b means "a is true, if b is true" (Backwards implication).
  - Avoid P=F, Q=T
  - Avoid A=F, B=T
  - Require B=T
    - From this, B must be T
    - If B must be true, Then A must also have to be true (B implies A)
    - Thus there are 3 valid combinations for PQ
  - And thus there are 3 possible models
