## question:

Which of the following statements about a solution (a path to a goal node) found by depth-first search (DFS) is true?

Question 1 Select one or more:
a. The algorithm always finds the deepest solution---a path with the largest number of arcs.

b.The length (number of arcs) of the solution found by DFS depends on the order of children (edges) in the graph.

c.The algorithm always finds a solution with the lowest cost.

d.The algorithm always finds the shallowest solution---a path with the fewest number of arcs.

### Questions
#### a logic
- Does DFS always find deepest solution?
    - It will find the deepest solution only if it explores every possible path.
    - Otherwise, DFS can return a shallower solution if it is found earlier. 
    - thus a is false

#### b logic
- how does the order of children effect dfs?
  - order of children strongly effects dfs
  - thus b is true

#### c logic
- dfs just finds first solution. It does not consider cost. That is what A* and Dijkstra is for.
  - thus c is false

#### d logic
- again same as a logic
- just finds the first solution
  - thus d is false
