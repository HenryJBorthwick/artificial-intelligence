# prolog recursion theory

### question
```
Which of the following is the correct way to define the recursive rule for the descendant relationship? Note that while logically all of these are equivalent, we need to choose a form that works correctly with the proof search process
```

### options
```
descendant(X, Y) :- child(X, Z), descendant(Z, Y).
descendant(X, Y) :- child(X, Y).

descendant(X, Y) :- child(X, Y).
descendant(X, Y) :- descendant(X, Z), child(Z, Y).

descendant(X, Y) :- descendant(Z, Y), child(X, Z).
descendant(X, Y) :- child(X, Y).

descendant(X, Y) :- child(X, Y).
descendant(X, Y) :- child(X, Z), descendant(Z, Y).
```

### logic and reasoning
- between option 2 and 4 because recursion has base case first.
- option 4 because it needs to check for base case before going to recursive case

### additional learning
- parent, child, ancestor and descendant relationships:


- DESCENDANT: X is a direct descendant of Y IF X is a child of Y OR indirect descendant when X is a child of Z AND Z is a descendant of Y
- descendant(X, Y) :- child(X, Y).
- descendant(X, Y) :- child(X, Z), descendant(Z, Y).
  - TODO: How to convert to parent instead of child definition
  - descendant(X, Y) :- parent(Y, X).
  - descendant(X, Y) :- parent(Y, Z), descendant(X, Z).


- ASCENDANT: X is a direct ancestor of Y IF X is a parent of Y OR indirect ancestor X is a parent of Z AND Z is a ancestor of Y
- ascendant(X, Y) :- parent(X, Y).
- ascendant(X, Y) :- parent(X, Z), ascendant(Z, Y).
  - TODO: How to convert to child instead of parent definition
  - ascendant(X, Y) :- child(Y, X).
  - ascendant(X, Y) :- child(Z, X), ascendant(Z, Y).



- When solving problems determine if the facts are parent or child facts then if you need descendant or ascendant then implement it


- PARENT: X is a parent of Y if Y is a child of X
- CHILD: X is a child of Y if Y is a parent of X
