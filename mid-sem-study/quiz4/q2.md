### prolog unifies

### question
```
What unifies?

f(g(X)) = f(g(Y))
Auckland = Wellington
anything = anything
chch = Christchurch
f(X) = f(2)
brothers(bob, sam) = brothers(sam, bob)
christchurch = Christchurch
```

- f(g(X)) = f(g(Y)) does as identical functor and argument number 
  
- Auckland = Wellington does as both variables

- anything = anything does as identical atoms

- chch = Christchurch does as atom and variable

- f(X) = f(2) does as compound terms with same functor and number of arguments

- brothers(bob, sam) = brothers(sam, bob) does not as compound terms require same order of arguments 

- christchurch = Christchurch does as atom and variable

## prolog terms
- Unification is trying to make terms identical. Tries to find a suitable substitution. If a substitution exists, then it unifies.

- terms are either atoms or compound terms
- Variables are _ or starting with uppercase letters and substituted with a atom or number or other terms
- Atoms lowercase identifiers
- Compound Terms: Consist of functor and number of arguments f(X, Y), brothers(bob, sam)
