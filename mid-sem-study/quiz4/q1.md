### question
```
Which of the following statements correctly describes these rules?

For all nodes X and Y, there is a path from X to Y if there exists a node Z such that there is an edge from X to Z and there is a path from Z to Y, or there is an edge from X to Y.

There exists a node Z such that for all nodes X, there is a path from X to Y if there is an edge from X to Z and there is a path from Z to Y, or there is an edge from X to Y.

For all nodes X and Y, there is a path from X to Y if for all nodes Z there is an edge from X to Z and there is a path from Z to Y, or there is an edge from X to Y.

For all nodes X, there exists a node Y such that there is a path from X to Y if there is an edge from X to Z and there is a path from Z to Y, or there is an edge from X to Y.

There exists a node Z such that for all nodes X and Y, there is a path from X to Y if there is an edge from X to Z and there is a path from Z to Y, or there is an edge from X to Y.
```

### knowledge base
```
path(X, Y) :- edge(X, Y).
path(X, Y) :- edge(X, Z), path(Z, Y).
```

- rule 1 in english: there is a path from X to Y if there is a edge from X to Y. If edge(X,Y) is true then path(X,Y) is true
- rule 2 in english: there is a path form X to Y if there exists some node Z such there is a edge X to Z AND a path from Z to Y. If edge(X,Z) true and path(Z,Y) then path(X,Y) is true. Recursive rule as it references itself.

-question1: this matches the best. There exists implies just one Z node which is correct and for all X and Y which is correct as they are always in pairs across both rules.

- Using universal quantifiers for all X and Y.
- Introducing an existential quantifier for Z, aligning with the recursive rule.
- Combining both direct and indirect path conditions appropriately.

- NOTE: If it has multiple conditions they all must be satisfied. But if it references its or another functions name, its recursive. Recursion is for iterative or chained reasoning.
