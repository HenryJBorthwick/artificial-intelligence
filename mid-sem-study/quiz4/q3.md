# prolog proof search

### knowledge base
```
f(a).
f(b).
f(c).
g(b).
g(c).
h(c).
k(X):-f(X), g(X), h(X).
```

### question
```
Suppose the user asks the query k(X). When searching for the proof (solution), which of the listed (sub)goals are tried, and in what order? If the search stops in fewer than 10 steps, use '.' for the remaining steps.
```

- f(x) and g(x) and h(x) are all facts and k(x) is a rule.
- k(x) in english: for an X, K(X) is true if all of f(x), g(x) and h(x) are true
- Complete each sub goal of the conditional statement, when fail to unify, then backtrace

- PROOF SEARCH TRACE
- look for f(X) match, note that the uppercase X is a variable and a argument for f() functor
- f(a), match found, unifies
- look for g(X) match, X=a, so g(a)
- g(a), fails to unify, does not exist in knowledge base
- back track to f(X) and try for new match
- f(b), f(X) unifies with f(b), X=b
- look for g(X) match, unifies with g(b), match found X=b
- look for h(X) match, not match, backtrack to f(X) again
- look for f(X) match, unifies with f(c), X=c
- look for g(c) match, unifies with g(c)
- look for h(c) match, unifies with h(c)
- k(c) is true, final binding being X = c

- PROOF SEARCH TRACE ANSWER FORMAT
```
1. f(a)
2. g(a)
3. f(b)
4. g(b)
5. h(b)
6. f(c)
7. g(c)
8. h(c)
