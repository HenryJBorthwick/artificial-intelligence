### A* theory

## question
```
Determine whether the following statements are true or false. In all the statements "the algorithm" refers to A* graph search without pruning. In all cases assume that graphs are finite and the cost and heuristic values are non-negative and finite.
```

### question1
```
If h1(node) and h2(node) are two valid heuristic functions for the algorithm, then the heuristic function h(node) defined as max(h1(node), h2(node)) is also a valid heuristic function for the algorithm. 
```
#### reasoning:
- true, a valid heuristic function will never over estimate, thus even the larger estimate of the two functions will also be valid


### question2
```
If h1(node) and h2(node) are two valid heuristic functions for the algorithm, then the heuristic function h(node) defined as min(h1(node), h2(node)) is also a valid heuristic function for the algorithm
```
#### reasoning:
- true, a valid heuristic function will never over estimate, thus even the minimum estimate of the two functions will also be valid


### question3
```
If a heuristic function underestimates the cost to a goal node, the algorithm may find a non-optimal solution.
```
#### reasoning:
- false, underestimating means that the heuristic function is still admissible because it underestimates the the cost of a path to a goal node, means that the algorithm will still find an optimal solution 


### question4
```
If a heuristic function underestimates the cost to a goal node, the algorithm may not find a solution when there is one.
```
#### reasoning:
- false, because the function underestimates the cost to a goal node, then it is admissible, because it is admissible, then it is complete because it is a finite graph means that it will find a solution if one exists.


### question5
```
If a heuristic function overestimates the cost to a goal node, the algorithm may find a non-optimal solution
```
#### reasoning:
- true, overestimates means not admissible, thus non optimal solution is possible


### question6
```
If a heuristic function overestimates the cost to a goal node, the algorithm may not find a solution when there is one
```
#### reasoning:
- false, overestimates means not admissible, meaning completeness can be compromised, but graph is finite, A* will explore every possible node because there is no pruning, but it will find a solution
