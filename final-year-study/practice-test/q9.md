### CSP theory

#### question
```
A CSP instance can be solved as an optimisation problem by using an appropriate heuristic (cost) function. When using the greedy descent algorithm to solve these problems, the algorithm may get stuck in local optima. Which of the following is commonly used to alleviate this issue?
```

#### answer 1 and reasoning
- Taking some random steps during the search
  - Selecting a random neighboring state
  - Allows algorithm to potentially escape local optima by exploring new areas

#### answer 2 and reasoning
- Restarting the search from a new random state;
  - Restarting search process from a new random initial state after getting stuck
  - Provide multiple opportunities to find a path to global optimum

#### answer 3 and reasoning
- Using hill climbing instead of greedy descent and then inverting the solution
  - neighboring

#### answer 4,5 and reasoning
- Using a heuristic function that underestimates the cost
- Using a heuristic function that overestimates the cost
  - In local search algorithms like greedy decent, the heuristic is usually the cost function itself
  - Yes for informed search algorithms like A*, but not for local optima searching
