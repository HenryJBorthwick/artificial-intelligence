### binary classification question quiz10

### question context
```
Consider a binary classification problem (i.e. there are two classes in the domain) where each object is represented by 2 numeric values (2 features). We are using a single perceptron as a classifier for this domain and want to learn its parameters. The weight update rule is w←w+ηx(t−y). We use the following configuration.
```

### configuration
```
weights = [1, 1]
bias = 1
learning_rate = 0.5
examples = [
    ([1, -1], 0),   # index 0 (first example)
    ([1, 4], 0),
    ([-1, -1], 1),
    ([3, 4], 1),
]
```

### question 
```
Answer the following with numeric values. Do not use fractions.

After seeing the example at index 0, the value of the weight vector is [Answer 1, Answer 2] and the value of bias is Answer 3.

After seeing the example at index 1, the value of the weight vector is [Answer 4, Answer 5] and the value of bias is Answer 6.

After seeing the example at index 2, the value of the weight vector is [Answer 7, Answer 8] and the value of bias is Answer 9.
```

#### statement 1 answers and reasoning
- new weight = [0.5, 1.5]
- new bias = 0.5
