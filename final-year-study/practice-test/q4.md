#### explanation summary
- Clauses with heads matching the goals (c or a) or necessary sub-goals are candidates for selection.
- Clauses unrelated to the goals or sub-goals will never be selected.
- Selection depends on clause order and the success or failure of previous attempts.
- When a clause is necessary to succeed in proving a goal, it will always be selected.
- When selection depends on order or prior failures, the answer is "may or may not be selected".
