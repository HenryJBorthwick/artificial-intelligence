A* superior to LCFS as has heuristic value
A* same as LCFS if heuristic value 0
A* same as BFS if heuristics to 0 and costs to 1

Heuristic functions
- Chesbyshev Distance when equal every direction
- Manhattan Distance when no diagonal
- Euclidean Distance any direction without grid layout

Natural way to construct Bayesian Networks (Causal relationships)
- Events or variables as nodes
- Causal dependencies or influences represented as direct edges

How to tell if model over fitting
- Higher accuracy on training set than test set

Purpose of mutation in evolutionary algorithms
- add diversity to population to try new ideas

Purpose of crossover in evolutionary algorithms
- combine and carry on good ideas

Game Tree
- ordering subtrees differently can improve pruning

CSP Problems
- local search
  - Efficiency in large complex spaces where exact solution is not necessary
- arc consistency
  - Lack of completeness, get stuck in local optima and miss global solution entirely

Belief network vs Join Distribution Complexity
- Joint Require 2^n probabilities for all possible combinations
